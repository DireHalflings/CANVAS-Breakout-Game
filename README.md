# Breakout Game
### Work-in-progress
I decided to start making a game as i am bored and do not have enough projects at my bootcamp. I decided to go with a breakout game because i always enjoyed them and there were many how to guides online. I am mostly learning this from mozilla.org tutorial, trying to turn their code into my code. I am trying to make everything in the game a variable so it can be easily modified in the future as i want to add power ups and multiple levels.
