## Summary

This is a standard breakout game. It is android friendly (currently not working on iOS). It features game menus, lives, score, multiple levels, and power ups. 

## The Journey

I began this project because I have always been interested in how games function. I chose breakout because it was always one of the more common and simple games I use to play that I really enjoyed. Starting off this project I was following along with the MDN breakout game tutorial, however after following the guide up to adding the ball collision with the paddle I saw a path to implementing all the other mechanics of the game myself. I stopped following the MDN guide and began writing my own code, adding wall collision, brick collision, brick generation, levels, a game interface, life and score tracking, and special powers. I learned a lot about programming during this project, the largest take away being that I should have favored objects over arrays in many places.
